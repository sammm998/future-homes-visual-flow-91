    <h2>Understanding Indonesian Property Law</h2>
    <p>Understanding Indonesian property law is crucial for foreign investors considering Bali real estate. While restrictions exist, several legal pathways enable international ownership with proper planning.</p>

    <p>Indonesia maintains strict regulations on foreign property ownership, but these laws have evolved to accommodate international investment while protecting national interests. The key is understanding the legal structures available and choosing the right approach for your situation.</p>

    <h2>Leasehold Ownership (Hak Sewa)</h2>
    <p>The most straightforward option for foreigners is leasehold ownership. This allows you to lease land for up to 25 years, with the possibility of extending for another 25 years. Many successful international property owners use this structure.</p>

    <p>Benefits of leasehold include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Direct ownership rights during the lease period</li>
      <li>Ability to build, renovate, and monetize the property</li>
      <li>Clear legal framework with established precedents</li>
      <li>Lower initial investment compared to other structures</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Indonesian Company Structure (PT PMA)</h2>
    <p>Foreign investors can establish an Indonesian company (PT PMA - Penanaman Modal Asing) to own property. This requires a local partner holding at least 51% of the company, but provides more permanent ownership rights.</p>

    <p>Key considerations for PT PMA structure:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Requires ongoing compliance with company regulations</li>
      <li>Annual reporting and tax obligations</li>
      <li>Need for trusted local partners</li>
      <li>Higher setup and maintenance costs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Nominee Ownership Arrangements</h2>
    <p>Some investors use nominee arrangements where an Indonesian citizen holds the property title on behalf of the foreign investor. However, this approach carries significant legal risks and is not recommended by legal experts.</p>

    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Nominee arrangements can result in loss of investment and legal complications. Always consult with qualified Indonesian legal counsel before considering this option.</p>

    <h2>Due Diligence Requirements</h2>
    <p>Proper due diligence is essential for any property investment in Bali. This includes:</p>

    <h3>Title Verification</h3>

      <li>Verifying proper zoning and building permits</li>
      <li>Ensuring compliance with environmental regulations</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Legal Documentation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Property certificates (SHM, HGB, or appropriate title)</li>
      <li>Building permits (IMB)</li>
      <li>Tax clearance certificates</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Capital Gains Tax</h3>
    <p>When selling property, foreign owners may be subject to capital gains tax. The rate varies based on holding period and other factors. Proper tax planning can help optimize your tax position.</p>

    <h2>Banking and Finance</h2>
