'<h2>Understanding Dubai Property Laws for International Investors</h2>
<p>Dubai has opened its doors wide to international property investors, but understanding the legal framework is crucial for a successful investment. This comprehensive guide covers everything foreign buyers need to know about purchasing property in the UAE.</p>

<h3>Freehold vs Leasehold Properties</h3>
<p>In Dubai, foreign nationals can purchase freehold properties in designated areas. These areas include Dubai Marina, Palm Jumeirah, Downtown Dubai, and over 40 other approved zones. Freehold ownership grants you complete ownership rights, including the land.</p>

<h3>Essential Documentation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Valid passport with UAE residence visa or tourist visa</li>
<li>Emirates ID (for residents)</li>
<li>No Objection Certificate (NOC) from sponsor (for employed residents)</li>
<li>Bank statements proving funds</li>
<li>Property evaluation certificate</li>
</ul>

<h3>Legal Process and Costs</h3>
<p>The Dubai Land Department (DLD) oversees all property transactions. Registration fees are 4% of the property value plus AED 580 for administrative costs. Additional costs include broker commission (2-5%), mortgage registration (0.25%), and property inspection fees.</p>

<h3>Important Legal Considerations</h3>
<p>All contracts must be in Arabic and English. Ensure your lawyer reviews all documentation before signing. Property disputes are handled through RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Agency) arbitration.</p>',
